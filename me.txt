I am a writing instructor and a technical writer with 10 years experience designing curriculum, teaching writing to secondary and university-level students, and creating documents for a range of users. 

Writing offers endless opportunities to learn new tools and ideas, and I actively seek new opportunities through my work. From designing instructional modules on film analysis to modernizing legacy documentation, I believe that all texts can and should be relevant to multiple users. 

In my free time I'm a runner, reader, ukulelian, hiker, traveller, and sci-fi film buff.
